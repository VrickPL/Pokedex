## Pokedex
Pokedex is a **Pokemon encyclopedia**, where you can scroll and get to know different Pokemons!  
Pokemons are displaing with **Inifinite Scroll**, so all data is not downloaded at one time and is slowly downloading by scrolling.  
Tip at the top teach you that you can click on Pokemon and see some details about him.
If you want to refresh downloaded Pokemons, you can just drag down the screen.

## Search
Search Pokemon by typing his full name.  
You can also change search algorithm in **Settings** and search Pokemons by typing only few letters. This API doesn't let to search Pokemons by the part of the name, so to optimise searching you have to first scroll through Pokemons you want to find.
If Pokemon is catched, you will also see a Pokeball in preview image.
