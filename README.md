## Pokedex
Pokedex is a **Pokemon encyclopedia**, where you can scroll and get to know different Pokemons!  
Pokemons are displayed with **Infinite Scroll**, so all data are not downloaded at once and is slowly downloaded by scrolling.  
The tip at the top teaches you that you can click on Pok√©mon and see some details about him.
If you want to refresh downloaded Pokemons, you can just drag the screen down.

<a name="search"></a>
## Search
Search for Pokemon by typing its full name.  
You can also change search algorithm in **Settings** and search for Pokemons by typing only a few letters. This API doesn't let to search Pokemons by the part of the name, so to optimize searching, you have to first scroll through Pokemons you want to find.
If a Pokemon is caught, you will also see a Pokeball in the preview image.
